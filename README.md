# Identifying Menu Item Sentiment and Revenue Correlation for Optimized Restaurant Profitability

## Overview

This project analyzes online customer reviews and sales data to determine the correlation between customer sentiment towards specific menu items and their revenue performance.  The analysis aims to identify opportunities for menu optimization, including pricing adjustments and item removal/addition, to ultimately increase restaurant profitability.  The project involves data cleaning, sentiment analysis, statistical correlation analysis, and data visualization.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NLTK (or similar NLP library - specify if different)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note:*  You will need to provide the necessary data files (e.g., review data in CSV format, sales data in CSV format) in the specified location within the script (or adjust file paths within the script to match your data location).*


## Example Output

The script will print key findings to the console, including statistical correlations between sentiment scores and sales figures for each menu item.  Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., scatter plots showing the relationship between sentiment and sales, bar charts showing average sentiment scores per item) in the `output` directory.  These files will include descriptive filenames (e.g., `sentiment_sales_correlation.png`, `average_item_sentiment.png`).  The specific outputs will depend on the input data.


## Data Requirements

The project requires two CSV files:

* **reviews.csv:**  Contains customer reviews and associated menu items.  Should include at least columns for `review_text` and `menu_item`.
* **sales.csv:** Contains sales data. Should include at least columns for `menu_item` and `sales_amount`.
